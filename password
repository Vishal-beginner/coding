Steve, who is lazy and an expert of petty tricks, is annoyed of having to memorize the passwords. He may carry a memo, but it may be exposed to others. So, he thought of an idea.

 

He will create a password with the remaining numbers after removing the pairs of same numbers from a number string consisting of numbers 0~9. After removing the same number pairs, he can also remove the number pairs whose right and left numbers are the same. Following example shows the password from a number string after removing the applicable number pairs.  

 

 

 


 

 

[Input]

The first line of the input file provides the length of the test case. The next line contains the number character string without a space.

The character string consists of numbers between 0~9. The length of the character string N 10≤N≤100. The length of the password is smaller than the length of the character string.

 

 

[Output]

Each of 10 lines of the output file contains the answer (password) to each of 10 test cases. Each line begins with ‘#x’ followed by a space and then the answer. Here, x is the test case number.
