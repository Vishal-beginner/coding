A countryhas found out that there is a spy at a broadcasting network within the country.The spy was transmitting video by inserting cryptographic codes into it. It wasfound that a code consists of numbers that indicate important facilities in thecountry. Cryptographic code rules are as follows.   




Company A istrying to develop a scanner that can recognize these cryptographic codesaccurately and fast. Performance of the scanner is measured with the followingmethods.

    The freopen function below opens input.txt in read only mode and

    When you test your code with the sample data, you can use the function
    below to read in from the sample data file instead of the standard input.
    So. you can uncomment the following line for your local test. But you
    have to comment the following line when you submit for your scores.
